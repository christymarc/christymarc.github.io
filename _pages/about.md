I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Chicago, where I am advised by Professor [Grant Ho](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/). My research focuses on the application of AI to security problems and understanding the evolving privacy and security implications of generative AI. Apart from this, I am also interested in tech policy and the security of ML systems.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Pomona College. During undergrad, I worked with Professor [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//) in the [ARCS Lab](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/) and completed a senior thesis on the defense of federated learning against evasion attacks with Professors [Eleanor Birrell](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ebirrell/) and [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//). Through cybersecurity and software engineering internships, I also have experience building out ML-driven security solutions for sim-swap fraud detection and various mobile applications, including a social media platform for surfers called [SurfStop](https://github.com/christymarc/SurfStop).

If you have any interest in applying to grad school for CS, I have compiled some potentially helpful recourses based on my experience. See [Resources](https://christymarc.github.io/resources/) tab.

## Code To PhD
[Grace Li](https://www.grace-li.org/) and I lead [Code to PhD](https://codetophd.github.io/), a student-run inter-university initiative which aims to help underrepresented individuals apply to Computer Science related PhD programs and find mentorship to support them through their graduate studies. In line with this goal, we host office hours, panels, and a PhD Application Support Program. 

If you are interested in attending one of our events or participating in our PhD Application Support Program, fill out this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d) to connect with us!
