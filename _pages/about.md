I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Chicago, where I am advised by Professor [Grant Ho](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/). My research focuses on the application of AI to security problems and understanding the evolving privacy and security implications of generative AI. Apart from this, I am also interested in tech policy and the security of ML systems.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Pomona College. During undergrad, I worked with Professor [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//) in the [ARCS Lab](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/) and completed a senior thesis on the defense of federated learning against evasion attacks with Professors [Eleanor Birrell](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ebirrell/) and [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//). Through cybersecurity and software engineering internships, I also have experience building out ML-driven security solutions for sim-swap fraud detection and various mobile applications, including a social media platform for surfers called [SurfStop](https://github.com/christymarc/SurfStop).

## Code To PhD
[Grace Li](https://graceli458.github.io/) and I lead Code to PhD, a student-run inter-university initiative which aims to help underrepresented individuals apply to CS-related PhD programs and find mentorship to support them through their graduate studies. In line with this goal, we host office hours, panels, and a PhD Application Support Program. To learn more about our upcoming events/programs and how to get involved as a mentee or volunteer, visit our [website](https://codetophd.github.io/). 

## Resources
If you have any interest in applying to grad school for CS, I have compiled some potentially helpful recourses based on my experiences. See [Resources](https://christymarc.github.io/resources/) tab for more info.
